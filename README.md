# EMCCD Mixture Model

## Introduction

Like the name suggests, this library can be used to quickly fits a mixture model of an 
the output distribution of an EMCCD to some data. This model incorporates the effects
of readout noise, Parallel Clock Induced Charge and Serial Clock Induced Charge.  
Expectation Maximization if used to fit the model to the data.


the library is a modified version of [this](https://github.com/ethan-homan/gaussian-exponential-mixture),
 which models a simpler mixtures
